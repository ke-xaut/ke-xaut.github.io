##Why do you study?
For me ,My dream is to be a person who has agile insight and active thinking. The best way to let it come true is learning I think. I must know many things ,such as mathematics , physics and computer science. Sometime when you see something you don't know before you can learn it at eating time .When you learnt the blog or paper you have a special feeling although your haven't eat lunch.
##What do you study?
Sometimes,when I lie in bed at night,I will recall my past several years.Before I enter college I use full time study the class school managed. when I went to university I have some spare time to do the thing I like. Maybe It is a coincidence ÂŒwhen I was new man a club named _Science and Technology Association_ send me a message the content is I can enter this club preferentially. when I see the message I feel exciting. For this reason I can learn some thing before another people who don't join this club. At this club the word I heard most is _programming_ and _micro-control_  or _Smart Car_  all day you see this stuff and stay with some guy who do those things. Of course I also do this. At first I like those things you can see I carry a thick book full of mathematical ,coding or circuit diagram. My father is a people who had never read high school but he always remind  me read more and read wide. Those days I read some fiction and history. When I read more I see that there are many regions are worth to know. Read more and read wide know many things not only one region. You study one field's knowledge at one year maybe can help you become a professional people at this region but you will lose something at the same time.
##How do you study?
Yesterday, I saw one micro-blog at *sina weibo* ,the blog said one purpose of read university is to learn how to study. The style of study in university is totally different with senior high school ,at this place we should know how to study by self how to study quickly and efficiently. Some upperclassmen told you that you should study in practice ,join in contest if there have chance. when you find some point you don't know you can learn it at that time. At first I believe this method is a effective way to study good .When I go this way in person , I find maybe it's not a good way .It's bad. I can say he is a fickle person who think this method is right. When don't have the ability to some things, you try to do it ,you will find the receiving you gain is less than you anticipate. Because you don't know the reason way it can work  by this way or way the result is A not B .don't build house over the beach. When you want to do  a thing the first key point is you have ability to do it better.A good fundamental is necessary at all the time. Many people include me want to learn  something new something fashion ,but we don't realize  that we don't have the fundamental .when we read the book we meet many word we don't understand or we haven't seen  it before. we hesitate and suspect. We search the way which can help us study quickly and easier .I saw a blog two weeks ago it side study can be divide  six steps. first,acquiring knowledge ,at this step you gain get key point by your eyes and ears at class .Second, Understanding,At this step you must try to understand what you learnt last step. Third,expending,expend what you know,read more book and learn it deeply.Forth,debug,this steps can help you change the wrong thought,delete the wrong connection .The best way to debug is practice. Fifth,practicing,at this step you can do a item by what you learn.
##summary
At this world ,there are many things need we to learn. We should keep learning up to died.And a best way to study can help you study more efficient and more relaxed. We try to find the best way which suit for us all the time.We always study at this status.Try to study by your way,some day later you will realize you improvement.
