 When I entered university I thought it's the good time to do the things I like.so I spend much time do coding and robot or electronic making.It give me happy and enlightenment.By the way I know some people who like this too.

 Last summer vacation I use no more than fifteen days in my home stay with my family.Other time I do above thing with my friends at school.The first two years I try to improve my skill of computer science.Once I have time I will do that things, at least the thing is connect with computer,I learn new coding language and different computer operating system and read some book, it's no reason only love.The second year is same with first full of interest. Like a kid ,I feel all the things is fresh and interesting.Of course the things is point computer and new technology. When I read the story about the history of computer or software industry such as the creation of apple II or development of Microsoft's first operating system MS-DOS ,I surprise at people's creativity and brilliant idea.That people who change our world use their brain and sweat.I admire them deeply.And learn to them.

 This summer I choose spend my second summer vacation at school with a dozen of crazed guys.This vacation there have a contest name _TI cup undergraduate electronic design contest_ . Many student spend over one month get it ready. They did much exercise,learn much knowledge about it. when the contest come , we got the content of this year's subject and find solving scheme.After four days and three nights we finished it. My teammates and I satisfied with the result. At the reply time some unexpected bad things happen, but we also got a second prize of province. That great!

 After the contest ,other word,those days many students back home and the campus is more quitness ,you can't see much people in laboratory or basketball court. Some time when I sit front computer loney I miss my families. When I  enter university the time I talk with them is short down less than twenty days a year.As a son or a grandson I feel sorry to my father and grandma.I can's do some thing for my grandmother I feel ashamed. There are many year we haven't sit at one table eat dinner.Once I thought this I feel sad.

 Yesterday my roommates backed to school and our dormitory is liven up again. This is indicate we will began a new semester,we will be third year student soon. A new began also a new challenge. Although I want return home soon but I have to wait next long vacation come.I think It's October first.That time I will told this to my grandma. And my little brother will be happy because I can carry his to by some new book.This little devil is like learning ,like me young. 

 There are five days we will began the new travel, before it I hope we can make big progress at this semester.Study and others.Good luck.
