## Problem Statement

Create a class called StringDup. Given a string made up of ONLY letters and digits, determine which character is repeated the most in the string ('A' is different than 'a'). If there is a tie, the character which appears first in the string (from left to right) should be returned.

**Examples :**

input  output

aaiicccnn = c

aabbccdd = a

abasbf2dj2skl = 2

Here is the method signature :

public char getMax(String input);

We will check to make sure that the input contains only letters and digits (no punctuation marks or spaces).


## Definition

```
Class:	StringDup
Method:	getMax
Parameters:	String
Returns:	char
Method signature:	char getMax(String param0)
(be sure your method is public)

```
